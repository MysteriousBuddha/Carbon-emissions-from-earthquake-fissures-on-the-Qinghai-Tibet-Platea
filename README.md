Welcome to the GitHub page for the Earthquakes have accelerated the carbon dioxide emission rate of soils on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where we provide a script for calculating the carbon emissions from earthquake fissures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

The script "Code.py" introduce how to calculate the carbon emissions from earthquake fissures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plaeau. The code is fully operational under Python 3.9.2, and the used packages are numpy and pandas.
